phrase-counter
==============

Some people use the same phrases a lot.  I wanted an easier way to count them.
I also wanted to use Backbone.js.  This is sort of my proof of concept app.

Currently, the app stores everything in localStorage, but it can be transitioned to use
any sort of DB if the need arises.

What I'm using
--------------

* jQuery 1.8.2
* Backbone.js 0.9.2
* [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage)
* Underscore.js 1.4.0
* jqPlot 1.0.4r1120
